With the different types of ML models in your mind, let’s apply concept to practice.
00:05
In this lesson, you explore BigQuery ML and walk through the steps to build an ML model with SQL commands.
00:11
You learned about BigQuery, the primary data analytics tool on Google Cloud, from the previous lesson.
00:16
Although it started out solely as a data warehouse, over time it has evolved to provide features
00:20
that support the data-to-AI lifecycle, meaning you can perform both data analytics and build ML models within BigQuery.
00:28
In this lesson, you explore BigQuery’s capabilities to build ML models, and walk through the steps and key SQL commands to do so.
00:36
If you’ve worked with ML models before, you know that building and training them can be very time-intensive.
00:42
You must first import and prepare the data then experiment with different ML models and tune the parameters.
00:47
To improve the model performance, you also need to go back and forth to train the model with new data and features.
00:54
And finally you need to deploy the model to make predictions.
00:57
This is an iterative process that requires a lot of time and resources.
01:01
Now with BigQuery ML, you can manage tabular data and execute ML models in one place with just a few steps.
01:09
BigQuery ML tunes the parameters for you and helps you manage the ML workflow.
01:14
Let’s walk through the phases of a machine learning project and the key SQL commands.
01:19
In phase 1, you extract, transform, and load data into BigQuery, if it isn’t there already.
01:24
If you’re already using other Google products, like YouTube for example, look out for easy connectors to get that data into BigQuery before you build your own pipeline.
01:34
You can enrich your existing data warehouse with other data sources by using SQL joins.
01:40
In phase 2, you select and preprocess features.
01:43
You can use SQL to create the training dataset for the model to learn from.
01:48
BigQuery ML does some of the preprocessing for you, like one-hot encoding of your categorical variables.
01:56
One-hot encoding converts your categorical data into numeric data that is required by a training model.
02:03
In phase 3, you create the model inside BigQuery.
02:06
This is done by using the 'CREATE MODEL' command.
02:09
In this example, you want to create a ML model to predict customer purchasing behavior, specifically if they will buy this product in the future.
02:18
You give the model a name: ecommerce.classification.
02:22
You then specify the model type.
02:24
Remember the previous lesson about ML model types — if you want to predict whether a customer will buy or not, which ML model should you use?
02:33
That’s right!
02:35
A logistic regression model is the answer because you are solving a classification problem.
02:41
Other than the logistic regression model, BigQuery ML also supports other popular ML models, including regression
02:47
models such as linear regression, and other models, such as k-means clustering and time series forecasting models.
02:55
In addition to providing different types of machine learning models, BigQuery ML supports MLOps, machine learning operations.
03:02
MLOps turns your ML experiment to production and helps deploy, monitor, and manage the ML models.
03:09
You’ll learn more about MLOps later in this course.
03:13
You are recommended to start with simple options such as logistic regression and linear regression, and use the results as a benchmark
03:19
to compare against more complex models such as DNN (deep neural networks), which take more time and computing resources to train and deploy.
03:29
After specifying the model type, you also need to define the label column.
03:34
Why?
03:35
Remember the two major categories of ML models, supervised and unsupervised?
03:40
The former deals with labeled data and predicts a goal, whereas the latter handles unlabeled data and identifies a hidden pattern.
03:48
Is this a supervised or unsupervised model?
03:51
Of course, it’s a supervised classification problem, thus a labeled column.
03:56
From there, you can run the query.
03:59
In phase 4, after your model is trained, you can execute an 'ML.EVALUATE' query to evaluate the performance of the trained model on your evaluation dataset.
04:09
It’s here that you specify which evaluation metrics the model will access, such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
04:16
You’ll explore these metrics later in the next module.
04:20
FInally, in phase 5, when you’re happy with your model performance, you can then use it to make predictions.
04:26
To do so, invoke the 'ML.PREDICT' command on your newly trained model to return with predictions and the model’s confidence in those predictions.
04:35
With the results, your label field will have “predicted” added to the field name.
04:40
This is your model’s prediction for that label.
04:43
You’ll practice all these steps and the SQL commands using BigQuery ML in the hands-on lab.
