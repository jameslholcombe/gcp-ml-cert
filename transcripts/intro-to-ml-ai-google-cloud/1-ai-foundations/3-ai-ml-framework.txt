In this lesson, let’s explore the AI/ML framework on Google Cloud.
00:04
You learned about the benefits of using Google Cloud to develop AI and ML projects.
00:09
The next question you may have is: how do I start?
00:13
Assuming you are a data scientist and you want to develop an ML model from beginning to end, what options do you have?
00:19
Say you are an ML engineer, and you want to build an ML pipeline to automatically monitor the model performance.
00:25
What tools do you have?
00:26
Or perhaps you are an AI/ML developer who would like to leverage generative AI capabilities in an application.
00:33
What products can you use?
00:35
You’ll find all the answers in this course.
00:37
This course presents a toolbox, which is based on the AI/ML framework on Google Cloud.
00:43
The toolbox is organized into layers to make navigation easier.
00:47
You begin with the AI foundations layer in this module, module one, where you learn about cloud
00:51
essentials like compute and storage, and data and AI products that support your journey from data to AI.
00:59
You then advance to the AI development layer.
01:01
In module 2, you focus on the options to develop an ML model from beginning to end on Google Cloud, where
01:07
you explore the out-of-the-box solution like pre-built APIs, low or no-code solutions like AutoML, and the do-it-yourself approach like custom training.
01:19
In module 3, you walk through the workflow to build an ML model using Vertex
01:23
AI, the end-to-end AI development platform, from data preparation, to model training, and finally model serving.
01:30
Additionally, you learn how to automate this ML workflow using the Vertex AI Pipelines SDK.
01:37
Finally, you are introduced to generative AI in module 4, how it works, the tools to develop generative AI projects, and how generative AI empowers AI solutions.
01:53
No matter your role, module one provides you with an overview of the AI/ML framework on Google Cloud, the cloud infrastructure, and the data and AI products.
02:04
If you are a data scientist and would like to build your own ML models, module two and three walk through all the details you need to know.
02:11
If you are a ML engineer and would like to automate the ML pipeline, you may get the most useful information from module three.
02:18
If you are an app developer or even a business user and would like to leverage
02:22
generative AI in your applications, module 4 helps you navigate through the use case, tools, and technologies.
