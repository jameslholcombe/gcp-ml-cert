Before you start building ML models, let's take a look at model categories.
00:05
First let’s pause to clarify two terms: artificial intelligence and machine learning.
00:10
You may note that people often use the terms interchangeably, but they do have some difference.
00:16
Artificial intelligence, or AI, is an umbrella term that includes anything related to computers mimicking human intelligence.
00:23
Some examples of AI applications include robots, and self-driving cars.
00:28
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.
00:36
This is in contrast to traditional programming, where the computer is told explicitly what to do.
00:42
Machine learning mainly includes supervised and unsupervised learning.
00:46
You might also hear the terms deep learning, or deep neural networks.
00:49
This is a subset of machine learning that adds layers in between input data and output results to make a machine learn at more depth.
00:58
You’ll learn more about neural networks and deep learning later in the course.
01:02
So, what’s the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
01:07
Imagine two types of problems: In problem one you are asked to classify dogs and cats from a very large set of pictures.
01:15
You already know the difference between dogs and cats.
01:18
So you label each picture and pass the labeled pictures to a machine.
01:21
By learning from the data, in this case, pictures, with the answers, or labels, supervised learning is being
01:28
enacted, allowing the machine to tell if a new picture represents a dog or cat in the future.
01:35
In problem two you are asked to classify breeds of dogs.
01:38
Unfortunately this time you don’t know many of them and are not able to label the pictures.
01:43
So you send these unlabeled pictures to a machine.
01:46
In this case, the machine learns from the data without the answers and finds underlying patterns to group the animals.
01:52
This is an example of unsupervised learning.
01:56
Put simply, Supervised learning deals with labeled data, is task-driven, and identifies a goal.
02:02
Unsupervised learning, however, deals with unlabeled data, is data-driven, and identifies a pattern.
02:08
An easy way to distinguish between the two is that supervised learning provides each data point with a label, or an answer, while unsupervised does not.
02:18
There are two major types of supervised learning: The first is classification, which predicts a categorical variable, such as determining whether a picture shows a cat or a dog.
02:27
In ML, you use models like a logistic regression model to solve classification problems.
02:34
The second type of supervised learning is regression, which predicts a numeric variable, like forecasting sales for a product based on its past sales.
02:44
You use ML models like a linear regression model to solve regression problems.
02:49
There are three major types of unsupervised learning: The first is clustering, which groups together data
02:54
points with similar characteristics and assigns them to "clusters," like using customer demographics to determine customer segmentation.
03:03
You use ML models like k-means clustering to solve clustering problems.
03:08
The second type is association, which identifies underlying relationships, like a correlation between two products to place them closer together in a grocery store for a promotion.
03:18
You use association rule learning techniques and algorithms like Apriori to solve association problems.
03:26
And the third type of unsupervised learning is dimensionality reduction, which reduces the number of dimensions, or features, in a dataset to improve the efficiency of a model.
03:36
For example, combining customer characteristics like age, driving violation history, or car type, to create a simplified rule for calculating an insurance quote.
03:45
You use ML techniques like principal component analysis to solve these problems.
03:50
All right, time to test your learning!
03:53
You are asked to predict customer spending based on purchase history.
03:57
Is this supervised or unsupervised learning?
04:00
Yes, that’s supervised learning because you have the labeled data, the amount the customers have spent, and you want to predict their future purchases.
04:09
Is this a classification or a regression problem?
04:14
Yes, it’s a regression problem because it predicts a continuous number: future spending.
04:21
Which ML model should you use?
04:23
A logistic regression or a linear regression?
04:26
Yes, a linear regression.
04:30
A logistic regression model is for classification problems, while a linear regression model is for regression problems.
04:36
Let’s look at another scenario.
04:39
Imagine you are using the same dataset; however, this time you are asked to identify customer segmentation.
04:45
You don’t want to base your judgement on stereotypes such as age or gender, so you use a computer for help.
04:51
Is this supervised or unsupervised learning?
04:54
Yes, it’s unsupervised learning because you don’t have each customer labeled as belonging to a certain segment.
05:02
Instead, you want the computer to discover the underlying pattern.
05:06
Is it a clustering, association, or dimensionality deduction problem?
05:11
Yes, identifying customer segmentation is a clustering problem.
05:16
Which ML model should you use: logistic regression, linear regression, or k-means clustering analysis?
05:24
Right, it’s a clustering analysis scenario.
05:28
You will find these models within BigQueryML, AutoML, and custom training later on in this course.
