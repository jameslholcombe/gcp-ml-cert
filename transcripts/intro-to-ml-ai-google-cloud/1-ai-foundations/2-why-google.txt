Why AI and why Google?
00:03
These might be your first questions.
00:05
AI is a rapidly growing field with the potential to revolutionize many industries.
00:11
Google is a leader in the development of AI, and it offers a wide range of tools and technologies for AI development.
00:17
By learning about AI and using Google's tools and technologies, you can be a part of the next wave of innovation.
00:23
Let's begin!
00:25
We are living in the era of artificial intelligence.
00:28
How did we get here?
00:30
The first industrial revolution was powered by steam in the 18th century, the second by electricity in the 19th century, the third by information technology in
00:39
the mid-20th century and today we are in the fourth industrial revolution, which is powered by artificial intelligence, or AI, specifically generative AI, a recent AI development.
00:51
Generative AI helps produce content such as text, code, and images.
00:56
It has enormous potential and creates new opportunities.
01:00
Google has been implementing artificial intelligence into many critical products, systems, and services for over ten years.
01:07
For example, have you ever noticed how Gmail automatically suggests responses to a message that you’ve received?
01:13
This feature is called Smart Reply, which uses artificial intelligence to predict how you might respond.
01:19
Behind this intelligence is AI technology known as natural language processing, which is just one example of an impressive list of technologies that Google scientists and engineers are working on.
01:31
The goal of these technologies is not to exclusively benefit Google customers.
01:36
The goal is to enable every company to be an AI company by supporting them in their journey from data to AI.
01:43
So, for workers in the travel and hospitality field, this might mean using AI and ML to improve aircraft scheduling or provide customers with dynamic pricing options.
01:53
For retail-sector employees, it might mean using AI and ML to improve sales forecasting and optimize inventory planning.
02:01
The potential solutions are endless.
02:04
What are the problems in your business that artificial intelligence and machine learning might help you solve?
02:09
As an AI developer or a data scientist, you might be wondering, “Why should I trust Google for artificial intelligence and machine learning?”
02:18
Firstly, Google has been an AI-first company since the beginning.
02:22
Second, Google is the leader in AI and ML innovations.
02:26
Thirdly, Google is a believer in responsible AI.
02:29
Let's take a brief look at how Google began innovating data and AI in its products.
02:35
Data is the basis of AI.
02:37
Historically speaking, Google experienced challenges related to data processing quite early.
02:42
As a search engine, Google needed to constantly invent new data processing methods to index the World Wide Web and keep up with the rapidly growing internet.
02:52
The innovation started in the early 2000s from Google File System, or GFS, which is the foundation for Cloud Storage, and MapReduce, which aims to manage large-scale data processing.
03:03
To address the challenges of different types of data, whether structured or unstructured, and different processing requirements,
03:08
either streaming or batch, Google has continued to invent multiple products and technologies in data analytics and engineering.
03:17
For example, BigQuery, the data warehouse widely used on Google Cloud, can analyze large amounts of data and build ML models at the same time with SQL, Structured Query Language.
03:29
In 2015, Pub/Sub was invented to help build data pipelines for streaming analytics.
03:35
In the field of AI, Google has also contributed many key technologies.
03:39
For example, scikit-learn, the widely-used ML library in Python for general purposes, was a Google summer coding project back in 2007.
03:50
TensorFlow, an open-source ML platform focusing on training deep learning neural networks, was developed by Google in 2015 and has evolved in multiple versions.
04:01
The transformer, the basis of all generative AI applications seen today, was invented by Google in 2017.
04:10
From this, large language models evolved rapidly, including BERT, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, in
04:16
2018, LaMDA, Language Model for Dialogue Applications, in 2021, and PaLM, Pathways Language Model, in 2022.
04:27
In terms of AI products, Google built an end-to-end AI development platform that evolves from AutoML in 2018, to Al Platform in 2019, and Vertex AI in 2021.
04:40
In 2023, Google also announced a series of Generative AI products on Vertex AI such as Generative AI Studio and Model Garden.
04:49
You’ll explore all of these AI technologies and products in depth, later in this course.
04:56
Google is the leader in AI and ML innovations.
04:59
Here are four major reasons: All development tools are empowered by Google's state-of-the-art ML models.
05:06
So you build on the best.
05:09
Google provides an end-to-end development platform to convert an ML model from experiment to production.
05:15
So you can be more efficient.
05:17
Google provides a unified data-to-AI platform.
05:20
So you can develop data and AI projects with ease.
05:25
Like Google Cloud itself, the AI services are based on an efficient and scalable infrastructure.
05:30
So you can get more for less.
05:32
Google has been recognized as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud AI Developer Services for 4 consecutive years, from 2020 to 2023.
05:43
It has also received recognition in numerous annual industry awards and reports in recent years.
05:51
AI comes with its own set of unique challenges.
05:54
Google integrates responsible AI into its AI principles.
05:58
In June 2018, Google announced seven AI principles to guide its work.
06:03
These are concrete standards that actively govern Google’s research and product development and affect its business decisions.
06:10
Here’s an overview of each one:
06:13
1. AI should be socially beneficial.
06:17
Any project should take into account a broad range of social and economic factors and will
06:22
proceed only where we believe that the overall likely benefits substantially exceed the foreseeable risks and downsides.
06:30
2. AI should avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias.
06:37
We seek to avoid unjust effects on people, particularly those related to sensitive characteristics such as race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, income, sexual orientation, ability, and political or religious belief.
06:52
3. AI should be built and tested for safety.
06:57
We will continue to develop and apply strong safety and security practices to avoid unintended results that create risks of harm.
07:05
4. AI should be accountable to people.
07:08
We will design AI systems that provide appropriate opportunities for feedback, relevant explanations, and appeal.
07:15
5. AI should incorporate privacy design principles.
07:20
We will give opportunity for notice and consent, encourage architectures with privacy safeguards, and provide appropriate transparency and control over the use of data.
07:30
6. AI should uphold high standards of scientific excellence.
07:34
We will work with a range of stakeholders to promote thoughtful leadership in this area, drawing on scientifically rigorous and multidisciplinary approaches.
07:43
And we will responsibly share AI knowledge by publishing educational materials, best practices, and research that enable more people to develop useful AI applications.
07:53
7. AI should be made available for uses that accord with these principles.
07:59
Many technologies have multiple uses, so we’ll work to limit potentially harmful or abusive applications.
08:06
Establishing principles was a starting point, rather than an end.
08:09
They are a foundation that establishes what Google stands for, what to build, and why to build it, and they are core to the success of Google’s enterprise AI offerings.
08:21
To implement responsible AI, Google takes a series of steps.
08:25
Education and research, such as online training courses and guidebooks, are readily available at scale for all of our products and services.
08:35
Product and use case reviews are enacted.
08:37
Google has a central team that is dedicated to the ethical review of new AI and advanced technologies before launch.
08:44
The review metrics include machine-learning fairness, security, privacy, human rights, culture, and social sciences.
08:52
Finally, Google continues to develop governance and assurance tooling to support the responsible development and implementation of AI.
08:59
For example, Explainable AI offerings, which include such features as Model Evaluation, Model Monitoring, and Model Registry to support data and model governance.
09:09
In sum, Google’s AI principles revolve around its being an AI-first company with a rich
09:16
history in AI development, a leader in AI innovations, and a practitioner of Responsible AI ethics.
09:23
Now you know why you can trust Google for artificial intelligence and machine learning!
