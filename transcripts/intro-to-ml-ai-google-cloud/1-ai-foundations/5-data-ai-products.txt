In this lesson, let’s investigate the primary data and AI products on Google Cloud.
00:06
In the last lesson, you examined Google Cloud infrastructure, specifically compute and storage.
00:12
The final layer of the Google Cloud infrastructure that is left to explore is data and AI products.
00:18
As you explored in the earlier lesson, Google offers a range of data and AI tools.
00:23
So, how do you know which is best for your business needs?
00:27
Let’s look closer at the list of products, which can be divided into four general categories along the data-to-AI workflow: You gather data from multiple sources through ingestion and process.
00:38
The data is then saved in different types of storage based on data type and business needs.
00:44
You analyze the data and visualize the results.
00:47
And you can further train an ML model with historical data to either predict future trends or generate new content.
00:54
These tools are seamlessly connected on Google Cloud, making it easy for data scientists and AI developers to transition from data to AI.
01:03
For example, BigQuery provides embedded AI features that allow you to directly call SQL commands to train an ML model.
01:10
Additionally, on Vertex AI, the AI development platform, you can use SQL commands in a notebook to import data from BigQuery and further train ML models.
01:20
Let’s cover the products available in each stage of the data-to-AI workflow.
01:25
The first category is ingestion and process, which include products that are used to digest both real-time and batch data.
01:32
The list includes Pub/Sub, Dataflow, Dataproc, and Cloud Data Fusion.
01:38
Please check cloud.google.com/training for more training on data ingestion and process.
01:44
The second product category is data storage, and you’ll recall from earlier that there are
01:49
five storage products: Cloud Storage, which saves unstructured data such as text, image, audio and video.
01:57
Cloud SQL Cloud Spanner Cloud Bigtable, and Firestore.
02:03
Cloud SQL and Cloud Spanner are relational databases, while Bigtable and Firestore are NoSQL databases.
02:10
The third product category is analytics.
02:12
The major analytics tool is BigQuery, which you’ll explore more later in this module.
02:18
BigQuery is a fully managed data warehouse that can be used to analyze data through SQL commands.
02:23
In addition to BigQuery, you have BI, or business intelligence, tools to analyze data and visualize results.
02:29
For example: Looker, which is a comprehensive BI tool.
02:33
Looker offers different versions of its product such as Looker for enterprise use and Looker Studio for individual use.
02:40
And the final product category is AI and machine learning, which includes both AI development tools and AI solutions.
02:47
These products are either integrated with generative AI or embedded with generative AI capabilities: The major product to support AI development is Vertex
02:56
AI which is a unified platform and includes multiple tools such as AutoML, Vertex AI Workbench, Colab, Generative AI Studio, and Model Garden.
03:08
AI solutions are built on the ML development platform and include state-of-the-art technologies to meet both horizontal and vertical market needs.
03:17
These include: Document AI Contact Center AI Discovery AI for Retail, and AI for healthcare These products unlock insights that only large amounts of data can provide.
03:29
Many of them have been recently embedded with generative AI capabilities.
03:33
For example, Contact Center AI is equipped with chatbots that are powered with large language models to understand natural language and converse like a human agent.
03:43
You’ll explore the machine learning options and workflow together with these products in greater detail later.
