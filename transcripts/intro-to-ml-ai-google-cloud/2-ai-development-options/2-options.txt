Let’s begin with Google Cloud’s AI development options, which include out-of-the-box, low-code and no-code, and do-it-yourself.
00:07
You’ll explore the pros and cons of each and examine a decision tree to help you consider which option might be best for your business problem.
00:16
Imagine that you’re helping your organization use AI to transform your business model and operation.
00:22
Where and how should you start?
00:23
Let’s say you are a business user or an application developer, and you don’t have training data and lack experience developing an ML model.
00:32
However, you really want to use AI to automatically label and classify customer feedback.
00:37
What can you do?
00:39
Or perhaps you’re a data analyst, and you have some training data and experience using SQL.
00:45
How can you build a custom ML model with your existing skills?
00:48
Maybe you’re a data scientist, you have a large amount of data and want to train
00:51
a custom ML model; however, you don’t want to spend hours tuning ML parameters from the beginning.
00:58
What choices do you have?
01:00
Or what if you’re an ML engineer or scientist and enjoy using do-it-yourself models and code to operationalize the ML pipeline.
01:08
What tools can you use?
01:10
Well, you can find tools on Google Cloud to help achieve your goals, from preconfigured solutions such as pre-trained APIs, to low
01:19
or no-code solutions such as BigQuery ML and AutoML, to a completely DIY approach with a code-based solution by using custom training.
01:28
Let’s look at each of them.
01:31
Google Cloud offers four options for building machine learning models.
01:36
The first option is to use pre-trained APIs.
01:39
API stands for application programming interface.
01:43
This option lets you use pre-trained machine learning models, so you don’t need to build your own if you don’t have training data or machine learning expertise in-house.
01:53
The second option is BigQuery ML, which you learned about in the previous module.
01:58
This option uses SQL queries to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery.
02:04
If you already have your data in BigQuery and your problems fit the pre-defined ML models offered by BigQuery ML, this could be your choice.
02:13
The third option is AutoML, which is a no-code solution that helps you build your own machine learning models on Vertex AI through a point-and-click interface.
02:23
And finally, there is custom training, through which you can code your very own machine learning environment, training, and deployment.
02:31
This option allows you flexibility and control over the ML pipeline.
02:35
Let’s compare the four options to help you decide which one to use for building your ML model.
02:41
Note that the technologies change constantly and this is only a brief guideline.
02:46
BigQuery ML only supports tabular data, whereas the other three support tabular, image, text, and video.
02:54
Pre-trained APIs also process audio.
02:57
In terms of training data size, pre-trained APIs do not require any training data, Whereas BigQuery ML and custom training require a large amount of data.
03:08
Pre-trained APIs and AutoML are user friendly with low requirements for machine learning and coding
03:13
expertise, whereas custom training has the highest requirement, and BigQuery ML requires you to understand SQL.
03:22
At the moment, you can’t tune the hyperparameters with pre-trained APIs or AutoML; however, you can experiment with hyperparameters by using BigQuery ML and custom training.
03:34
Pre-trained APIs require no time to train a model because they directly use pre-trained models from Google.
03:40
The time to train a model for the other three options depends on the specific project.
03:45
Normally, custom training takes the longest time, because it builds the ML model from the beginning, unlike AutoML and BigQuery ML.
03:54
The best option depends on your business needs and ML expertise.
03:58
Budget is also an important consideration.
04:00
Visit Google Cloud’s website for detailed pricing information.
04:05
If you have little ML experience and no intention to train your own ML models, using pre-trained APIs might be the best choice.
04:14
Pre-trained APIs address common perceptual tasks such as vision, video, and natural language.
04:19
They are ready to use without any model development effort.
04:23
If your data engineers, scientists, or analysts are familiar with SQL and already have data in BigQuery, BigQuery ML lets you use SQL queries to build predefined ML models.
04:37
If you wish to build custom models with your own training data while you spend minimal time coding, then AutoML on Vertex AI is your choice.
04:46
AutoML allows you focus on business problems instead of the underlying model architecture and provisioning.
04:53
If your ML engineers and data scientists want full control of ML workflow, Vertex AI custom
04:58
training lets you train and serve custom models with code on Vertex AI Workbench or Google Colab.
05:06
Let’s walk through pre-trained APIs, AutoML, and custom training one by one later in this module.
