In the last lesson, you learned about Vertex AI, a unified platform that supports both AutoML, a no-code solution, and custom training, a code-based solution.
00:10
In this lesson, you’ll explore AutoML in depth, including the technologies used to power automated ML development.
00:18
AutoML, which stands for automated machine learning, aims to automate the process to develop and deploy an ML model.
00:28
If you've worked with ML models before, you know that building them can be extremely time consuming, because you
00:33
need to repeatedly add new data and features, try different models, and tune parameters to achieve the best result.
00:42
When AutoML was first announced in January of 2018, the goal was to save the manual
00:47
work from data scientists and automate machine learning pipelines from pre-processing data, to model training and deployment.
00:56
But how could this be done?
00:58
How can you trust AutoML to generate the best results without bias, and do so in a speedy way?
01:04
Let’s look deeper to explore how AutoML works and the main technologies behind it.
01:09
AutoML is powered by the latest research from Google.
01:13
It’s an ongoing endeavor.
01:15
There are four distinct phases.
01:18
Phase one is data processing.
01:20
After you upload a dataset, AutoML provides functions to automate part of the data preparation process.
01:27
For example, it can covert numbers, datetime, text, categories, arrays of categories, and nested fields
01:34
into a certain format of data so that it can be fed into an ML model.
01:41
Phase two includes searching the best models and tuning the parameters.
01:46
Two critical technologies support this auto search.
01:49
The first is called neural architect search, which helps search the best models and tune the parameters automatically.
01:57
And the second is called transfer learning, which helps speed the searching by using the pre-trained models.
02:03
Let’s look at transfer learning first.
02:06
Machine learning is similar to human learning.
02:09
It learns new things based on existing knowledge.
02:12
AutoML has already trained many different models with large amounts of data.
02:17
These trained models can be used as a foundation model to solve new problems with new data.
02:22
A typical example are large language models (LLM), which are general purpose, and can be pre-trained and fine-tuned for specific purposes.
02:31
LLMs are trained for general purposes to solve common language problems such as text classification, question answering, document summarization, and text generation across industries.
02:44
The models can then be tailored to solve specific problems in different fields such as retail, finance, and entertainment, using a relatively small size of field datasets.
02:56
Transfer learning is a powerful technique that lets people with smaller datasets or less computational power achieve great results by using pre-trained models trained on similar, larger datasets.
03:09
Because the model learns through transfer learning, it doesn’t have to learn from the beginning, so it can
03:13
generally reach higher accuracy with much less data and computation time than models that don’t use transfer learning.
03:21
Now let’s look at neural architecture search.
03:24
The goal of neural architecture search is to find optimal models among many options.
03:29
Specifically, AutoML Tries different architectures and models, and compares against the performance between models to find the best ones.
03:37
For instance, AutoML can search through multiple advanced ML models and automatically tune the parameters to find the best fit for your data.
03:47
In phase three, the best models are assembled from phase 2 and prepared for prediction in phase 4.
03:53
Note that AutoML does not rely on one single model, but on the top number of models.
03:59
The number of models depends on the training budget, but is typically around 10.
04:04
The assembly can be as simple as averaging the predictions of the top number of models.
04:09
Relying on multiple top models instead of one greatly improves the accuracy of prediction.
04:16
By applying these advanced ML technologies, AutoML automates the pipeline from feature engineering, to architecture search, to hyperparameter tuning, and to model ensembly.
04:29
It might seem that AutoML can do a better job than a human to find the optimal models that fit your data.
04:36
Perhaps the best feature of AutoML is that it provides a no-code solution.
04:41
You can point-and-click through a UI to build an ML model with your own data.
04:45
You’ll walk through the details from preparing training data, to train you model, and finally get prediction in the next module.
