In this lesson, you’ll explore Vertex AI, which is the unified platform that supports various technologies and tools on Google Cloud to help you build an ML project from end-to-end.
00:11
For years now, Google has invested time and resources into developing data and AI.
00:17
Google had developed crucial technologies and products, from scikit-learn as a Google summer coding project back in 2007, to Vertex AI and generative AI today.
00:28
As an AI-first company, Google has applied AI technologies to many of its products and services, like Gmail, Google Maps, Google Photos, and Google Translate, just to name a few.
00:40
But developing these technologies doesn’t come without challenges.
00:44
Some traditional challenges include handling large quantities of data, determining the right machine learning model to train the data, and harnessing the required amount of computing power.
00:55
Then there are challenges around getting ML models into production.
01:00
Some of the challenges can be scalability, monitoring, and continuous integration and deployment.
01:06
In fact, according to Gartner, only half of enterprise ML projects get past the pilot phase.
01:13
There are also ease-of-use challenges.
01:15
Many tools on the market require advanced coding skills, which can take a data scientist’s focus away from model configuration.
01:22
Without a unified workflow, data scientists often have difficulties finding tools.
01:27
Google’s solution to many of the production and ease-of-use challenges is Vertex AI, a unified platform that brings all the components of the machine learning ecosystem and workflow together.
01:39
So, what exactly does a unified platform mean?
01:43
There are two primary aspects: Firstly, it means that Vertex AI provides an end-to-end ML pipeline to prepare data, and create, deploy, and manage models over time, and at scale.
01:56
For instance, During the data readiness stage, users can upload data from wherever it’s stored: Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or a local machine.
02:05
Then, during the feature readiness stage, users can create features, which are the processed data that
02:10
will be put into the model, and then share them with others by using the feature store.
02:16
After that, it’s time for training and hyperparameter tuning.
02:20
This means that when the data is ready, users can experiment with different models and adjust hyperparameters.
02:27
And finally, during deployment and model monitoring, users can set up the pipeline to transform the model into production by automatically monitoring and performing continuous improvements.
02:38
You’ll learn how to do this later in the course, when you explore MLOps.
02:42
Also, Vertex AI is a unified platform because it provides different products, from preconfigured to DIY, to build an ML project.
02:52
Vertex AI allows users to build machine learning models with either AutoML, a no-code solution, or Custom Training, a code-based solution.
03:01
It also offers generative AI products that help you build applications, train models, and generate content in multiple modalities such as text, code, images, and speech.
03:11
You’ll explore more about generative AI later in this course.
03:16
Let’s focus on AutoML and custom training with Vertex AI in this module.
03:22
AutoML provides an easy to navigate UI.
03:25
It lets data scientists focus on what business problems to solve instead of how to code and deploy an ML solution.
03:33
Custom training gives data scientists and ML engineers more control over the development environment and process.
03:39
They can use tools like Vertex AI Workbench and Colab to DIY their ML projects.
03:45
One convenient feature is that data scientists can now write SQL with Workbench on Vertex AI to seamlessly connect BigQuery and Vertex AI.
03:56
Being able to perform such a wide range of tasks in one unified platform has many benefits.
04:03
This can be summarized with four Ss: It’s seamless.
04:07
Vertex AI provides a smooth user experience from uploading and preparing data all the way to model training and production.
04:15
It’s scalable.
04:17
The Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) provided by Vertex AI helps to monitor and manage the ML production and therefore scale the storage and computing power automatically.
04:28
It’s sustainable.
04:31
All of the artifacts and features created using Vertex AI can be reused and shared.
04:37
And it’s speedy.
04:38
Vertex AI produces models that have 80% fewer lines of code than competitors.
04:44
In addition to AutoML and custom training, Vertex AI also provides tools for generative AI.
04:51
You can use these tools to generate content and embed generative AI into your applications.
04:56
We will discuss generative AI technologies and tools later in this course.
