Hope you were inspired by the Duet AI use case from the previous lesson!

How can you start a generative AI project yourself?
00:07
Let’s explore the tools offered on Google Cloud.
00:11
Recall from the previous module that Vertex AI provides several options for model training and deployment.
00:17
These include AutoML, where you can build an ML model through Google Cloud console without code, and custom training, where you can code your own ML development environment and models.
00:29
These two options have been commonly used as a conventional approach to experiment, train, and deploy an ML model.
00:36
To meet the growing demand for generative AI, two new tools are now available: Model Garden and Generative AI Studio.
00:44
Are you looking to start a generative AI project but don't know where to begin or which model is right for you?
00:51
Model Garden on Vertex AI can be your entry point.
00:55
What is Model Garden on Vertex AI?
00:58
Model Garden is like a model search engine.
01:00
It is a single place to discover and interact with many of Google’s pre-trained and open-source models.
01:07
You can find three major categories of models: foundation models, task-specific solutions, and fine-tunable or open source models.
01:18
Foundation models are pretrained, multitask, large models that can be tuned or customized for specific tasks by using Generative AI Studio, Vertex AI APIs and SDKs.
01:31
Some of these models are PaLM for text and chat, Imagen for image, embeddings API for information extraction from text and image, Chirp for speech, and Codey for code generation.
01:43
Recall that you learned the APIs for these models in the previous section when you explored pre-trained APIs.
01:50
Task-specific solutions are pre-trained models and optimized to solve a specific problem.
01:56
These include some tasks you practiced in the previous section by using the Natural Language APIs, like entity analysis, sentiment analysis, and syntax analysis.
02:07
More interesting tasks like object detector and text translation are also task-specific solutions.
02:14
And finally there are fine-tunable models.
02:17
These are mostly open source models that you can fine-tune by using a custom notebook or pipeline.
02:23
To find the model that best suits your requirements, you can also use three filters in your search.
02:28
They are: Modalities: such as language, vision, and speech.
02:33
Tasks: like generation, classification, and detection.
02:37
And Features: such as pipeline, notebook, and one-click deployment support.
02:41
Let’s say you want to find a language model for a classification task that also provides APIs you can embed into your application code.
02:50
In this case PaLM 2 for Text is your choice.
02:54
With all these models to choose from, how can you start your workflow?
02:58
Model Garden lets you: Use Google's foundation models directly through the Google Cloud console with Generative AI Studio or through code with pre-built APIs.
03:08
Tune models in Generative AI Studio.
03:11
Deploy models to a notebook.
03:14
Customize and use open source models.
03:17
Let's walk through a use case of using Model Garden.
03:21
Assume you are interested in computer vision.
03:23
From the Model Garden page, let’s filter for vision-related models.
03:28
Next, in the Tasks section, select Detection.
03:33
Great!
03:34
The search result shows there's an Owl-Vision Transformer model, an open source model.
03:40
It says it's a zero-shot, text conditioned object detection model that can query an image with one or multiple text queries.
03:48
Let's dive into this.
03:50
Here you see the model card, where you can see more details.
03:54
As a data scientist, you might want to try using this model, so you click on Open Notebook.
04:00
This opens up a Colab notebook for the Owl-ViT model.
04:05
This notebook, in particular, shows how you can deploy the model to an endpoint on Vertex AI, then send
04:09
an image to the endpoint to get a prediction, which is a text caption describing what's in the image!
04:16
As this example illustrates, the flow from finding a model to deploying and using it becomes super easy with Model Garden.
04:24
Hope you enjoyed this demo.
