In the previous module, you learned how to develop an ML model from beginning to end.
00:06
More specifically, you walked through the ML workflow and explored how to convert it into an automated pipeline.
00:13
In this module, you learn about Generative AI, the most recent AI innovation that offers a wide range of exciting opportunities.
00:22
You explore the generative AI tools that assist AI development and the integration of its capabilities into AI solutions.
00:30
You start with the concepts and history of generative AI and large language models, or LLMs, which are the primary models that empower generative AI.
00:40
You are then introduced to a use case, where you learn how to apply generative AI in practice to build Duet AI, an AI assistant for developers across Google Cloud.
00:51
After that, you explore two tools on Vertex AI to use generative AI in ML development.
00:57
First is Model Garden, which is like a model search engine and the entry point to all AI models and tools.
01:04
The second is Generative AI Studio, which is a powerful tool to help you develop generative AI projects and tune language models.
01:12
You then advance to AI solutions, and learn how generative AI supercharges their features.
01:18
Finally, you have a hands-on lab using Generative AI Studio to create prompts and conversations.
01:24
