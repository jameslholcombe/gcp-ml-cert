You learned about Model Garden, an entry point to start a generative AI project, and Generative AI studio, a tool to develop generative AI projects in the previous lessons.
00:11
In this lesson, you examine AI solutions and how to use generative AI to supercharge their features.
00:18
In the previous lessons, you were introduced to generative AI and how to use it in development to help design applications and train language models.
00:20
In this lesson, you focus on AI solutions and embedded generative AI features.
00:21
AI solutions includes two groups, vertical and horizontal solutions.
00:24
Vertical or industry solutions refer to solutions that solve specific problems within certain industries.
00:32
Examples include: AI for healthcare, which generates healthcare insights and provides services across patients, doctors, and hospitals.
00:41
And Discovery AI, which enables retailers to provide Google-quality search and recommendations on their own digital properties, which can help increase conversion rate and reduce search abandonment.
00:53
Horizontal solutions, in contrast, usually refer to solutions that solve similar problems across different industries.
01:00
For instance, Contact Center AI, or CCAI, aims to improve customer service in contact centers through the use of artificial intelligence.
01:11
It can help automate simple interactions, assist human agents, and unlock caller insights.
01:17
Document AI uses computer vision, optical character recognition, and natural language processing to create pre-trained models that can extract information from documents.
01:28
This increases the speed and accuracy of document processing, which can help organizations make better decisions faster and reduce costs.
01:36
Let’s dive into CCAI, explore its main features and learn how generative AI supercharges them.
01:44
Contact Center Artificial Intelligence (CCAI) is Google’s solution to apply AI in contact centers.
01:50
The goal is to use AI to increase the customer satisfaction and the operational efficiency, while requiring minimum AI expertise.
02:00
At the center of Contact Center AI is the conversational core, which empowers three major components: virtual agent, Agent Assit, and Insights.
02:10
Let’s briefly look at how Contact Center AI works.
02:15
When a customer contacts CCAI, the system automatically determines whether the request is routine or complex.
02:23
Routine requests are passed to a virtual agent, a large language model-powered bot that can converse naturally with customers.
02:31
The virtual agent may then process the request and pass it to backend fulfillment.
02:36
Complex requests are sent to the agent assist, an AI assistant that helps human agents summarize the problem, gather information, provide solutions, and generate insights.
02:48
Relevant information and insights can also be saved to the knowledge base throughout the process.
02:54
Now let’s look at how generative AI is used to transform the CCAI platform.
02:59
Today the Contact Center AI platform is an end-to-end, AI-first Call Center as a Service (CCaaS) solution
03:05
that is integrated with a set of prebuilt tools and features including Virtual Agent, Agent Assist, and Insights.
03:13
The platform will soon be upgraded with natural language understanding-powered call and chat, as well as ML-driven routing.
03:20
This means that the platform will be able to understand what customers are saying and direct them to the appropriate person or department.
03:28
It will also be able to learn from the interactions and improve its routing over time.
03:33
Today, a CCAI virtual agent provides 24/7 customer self-service.
03:39
It provides a conversational voice and chat bot that a customer can get help from any time using natural language.
03:46
It also integrates the function to handoff calls to live agents.
03:50
Through generative AI, the bots will be faster and easier to use.
03:54
They will also be able to handle a wider range of customer interactions, answer customer questions in a more comprehensive and accurate way, and engage in natural conversations with customers.
04:06
Today, AI agent assist empowers live agents with step-by-step help during calls and chats.
04:13
It also provides agents an automated summary of every interaction afterwards.
04:18
In the near future, the Agent Assist will be enhanced with a generative AI feature that can coach live agents on-demand.
04:25
CCAI insights currently use natural language processing to analyze conversations such as sentiment analysis, entity identification, and topic detection.
04:37
These insights can be used to improve the performance of virtual and live agents.
04:42
They can also be used to create training materials for agents and to identify areas where customer service can be improved.
04:50
Soon Insights will generate FAQs automatically to improve customer experience with generative AI capabilities.
04:57
You can learn more about Google Cloud’s growing list of AI solutions and their embedded generative AI capabilities at cloud.google.com/solutions/ai.
05:10
With the rapid development of AI and machine learning, you might hear exciting news everyday.
05:16
What do you think about the future of AI and machine learning?
05:19
Here are a few of our expectations: The transition from data to AI is inevitable: Data is the fuel that powers AI, and AI extracts insights and possibilities from data.
05:32
As AI becomes increasingly powerful and capable, it will learn and adapt in ways that data alone cannot.
05:38
As a result, AI is becoming more and more essential for businesses that want to stay ahead of the competition.
05:45
Generative AI becomes more important.
05:48
It will be used to produce content and improve productivity, which will create new opportunities and offer great potential.
05:55
And these opportunities will be more accessible to all, as AI and ML development tools
06:01
become easier to use, which allows people without a technical background to benefit from their capabilities.
06:07
What do you think, dear learners?
