In the previous section of this course, you learned about different options to develop an AI project on Google Cloud, from
00:06
an ready-to-use approach like pre-trained APIs, to low or no-code solutions like AutoML, and to DIY solutions, such as custom training.
00:17
In this section, you further investigate how to develop an AI project on Google Cloud.
00:22
Specifically, you walk through the ML workflow and explore how to create an automated pipeline.
00:29
To understand machine learning terms, you must first understand how neural networks learn.
00:34
This includes exploring the learning process and the terms associated with it.
00:38
Equipped with the essential terminologies, you then explore the overall ML workflow.
00:42
You then focus on the first stage of the workflow, data preparation, which includes data uploading and feature engineering.
00:49
After that, you advance to the second stage, model development.
00:53
This includes model training and evaluation.
00:54
You then proceed to the third stage, model serving.
00:58
This includes model deployment and monitoring.
01:01
Next, you learn about machine learning operations, or MLOps, which takes ML models from development to production.
01:08
You’ll also be shown an example of how to build a pipeline to automate the training, evaluation, and deployment of an ML model by using Vertex AI Pipelines.
01:18
Finally, you have an AutoML with Vertex AI hands-on lab.
01:21
In the lab, you walk through the three stages to build an ML model, from data preparation, to model development, to model serving.
01:28
Let’s get started!
