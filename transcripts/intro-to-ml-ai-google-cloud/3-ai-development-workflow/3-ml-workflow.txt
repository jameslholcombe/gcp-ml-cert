Now that you’re equipped with the essential ML terminologies, let’s advance to the ML workflow and walk through the main stages.
00:08
Building an ML model is actually not too different from serving food in a restaurant.
00:12
You start by preparing raw ingredients and finish by serving the dishes on the table.
00:17
There are three main stages to the ML workflow with Vertex AI.
00:21
The first stage is data preparation, which includes two steps: data uploading and feature engineering.
00:28
A model needs a large amount of data to learn from.
00:31
The quality and quantity of the data decide how much and how well the machine learns.
00:36
The data used in machine learning can be real-time streaming data or batch data.
00:41
The data can also be structured or unstructured.
00:44
Structured data is data that can be easily stored in tables, such as numbers and text.
00:49
Unstructured data is data that cannot be easily stored in tables, such as images and videos.
00:55
The second stage of the ML workflow is model development.
00:59
A model needs a tremendous amount of iterative training.
01:03
This is when training and evaluation form a cycle to train a model, then evaluate the model, and then train the model some more.
01:11
The third and final stage is model serving.
01:14
A model needs to actually be used in order to predict results.
01:18
This is when the machine learning model is deployed and monitored.
01:22
If you don’t move an ML model into production, it has no use and remains only a theoretical model.
01:29
Compare this process to serving food in a restaurant, data preparation is when you prepare the raw ingredients, model development is
01:35
when you experiment with different recipes, and model serving is when you finalize the menu to serve the meal to customers.
01:43
Now, it’s important to note that an ML workflow isn’t linear, it’s iterative.
01:48
For example, during model training, you might need to return to the raw data and generate more useful features to feed the model.
01:57
When monitoring the model during model serving, you might find data drifting, or the accuracy of your prediction might suddenly drop.
02:05
You might need to check the data sources and adjust the model parameters.
02:08
Fortunately, these steps can be automated with MLOps.
02:11
You’ll learn more about this later in this module.
02:15
Although the main stages remain the same, you have two options to set up the workflow with Vertex AI:
02:21
The first choice is to use AutoML, a no-code solution that lets you build an ML model through UI.
02:28
It's user friendly and doesn't require a lot of ML expertise.
02:31
Also, no coding skills are needed.
02:33
2.
02:34
Alternatively, you can code the workflow with Vertex AI Workbench or Colab using Vertex AI Pipelines.
02:40
Vertex AI Pipelines is essentially a tool kit that includes pre-built SDKs and software development kits, which are the building blocks of a pipeline.
02:50
Coding the pipeline is a good option if you're an experienced ML engineer or data scientist and want to automate the workflow programmatically.
02:58
Let’s focus on AutoML next, and then explore the code-based approach later in this module.
